How to download/compile:
The compiled executable is already included in this repo so you don't have to compile it, but if you want to compile it you will need gcc installed. Note: the executable was compiled on Windows so it may not work on Linux or Mac. 

Steps:
- Download this repo, and extract it to a folder.
- Then, in a command prompt, navigate to the extracted folder and type `gcc main.c board.c -o game.exe`
- This will generate an executable which you can run. 

How to run the game:

Run game.exe by double clicking on it. This will bring up a terminal where the game is played.
